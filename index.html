            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>Laburnum for My Head is a collection of short stories by Temsula Ao that brings to life the experiences of people in Nagaland, a state in Northeast India. The book is filled with rich descriptions of the region's culture and landscapes, making you feel as if you are right there with the characters.</p>

<p>The title story, "Laburnum for My Head," introduces us to an elderly woman who dreams of having a beautiful laburnum tree planted over her grave. This story stood out to me because it highlights her quiet rebellion against societal norms and her desire for a personal legacy, which is both touching and thought-provoking.</p>

<p>In "Death of a Hunter," we meet a character named Imchanok, whose life takes a tragic turn due to the pressures of tradition and change. This story is powerful because it shows the conflict between old customs and new ways of thinking, a theme that runs throughout the book.</p>

<p>Another favorite of mine is "The Last Song," which follows a musician named Akum who struggles to keep his art alive in the face of modernization. Akum’s passion for his music and the challenges he faces make his story both inspiring and heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Temsula Ao's writing is poetic and vivid, painting a clear picture of Naga life and traditions. She skillfully weaves in folklore and local customs, making the stories feel authentic and immersive. However, some readers might find the pace a bit slow, as the author takes her time to delve deep into the characters' emotions and settings.</p>
